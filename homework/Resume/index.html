	<h1>About me</h1>

		“Our opportunity, as designers, is to learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple.” – Tim Parsey

		<p>My journey started as a graphic designer working in variety of projects, all the way from print to web.</p> 

		<p>I quickly fell in love with user experience, in the past six years I’ve learned the ins and outs of designing products for the web, taking into account user and business needs, creating wireframes and prototypes to test ideas, designing mockups and working with developers.</p> 

		<p>Also, a big part of designing for the web is the ability to measure success, I’ve been using tools such as Google Analytics and Optimizely for metrics.</p>

		<p>Also, if you don’t find me on my computer designing and looking at the latest design trends and companies, you’ll find me around NYC with friends
